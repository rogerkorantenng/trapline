# TRAPLINE

Think Minecraft, but instead of building a house, you build a trap course — and then watch the community try to beat it. Every level in TRAPLINE was made by another player using a tile editor built into the post. The game has no levels of its own.

You race short, brutal courses to the finish flag as fast as you can. Each course has a leaderboard and a ghost — a real-time replay of whoever holds the record. You're not chasing a timer. You're chasing the exact path the current record holder took through the level.

Wipe out and you leave a marker and a taunt at that spot. The next player sees everyone who came unstuck there before them. Three wipeouts in the same place and the game marks it as a danger zone. Finish and you can post your result as a Reddit comment — your time and medal, right in the thread.

## Controls

Move with arrow keys or `A` / `D`. Jump with `W`, `↑`, or `Space` — hold longer for more height. Dash with `Shift`. Slide down a wall and press jump to wall-jump off it. On mobile, tap anywhere to jump and use the on-screen buttons to run and dash.

The timer starts when you first move. Take your time reading the course before you go.

## Building a course

Hit BUILD from the menu. The editor lives inside the post — no external tool. Paint your course, name it, publish it. It shows up in the Community tab immediately for anyone to race.

The canvas extends as far right as you want to build. On publish the course is checked for solvability and given medal times calibrated to its length.

| Tile | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| ⬛ Ground · ▬ Platform | solid footing |
| █ Wall | solid block, good for wall-jump sections |
| ▲ Spike · ⚙ Saw | instant wipeout on contact |
| 👾 Goomba | patrols back and forth — stomp from above, or go around |
| 🔼 Spring | launches you high into the air |
| ◌ Vanish | disappears after the first touch |
| ⬇ Crusher | slams down from above |
| 🚩 Finish | one per course, place it last |

## Daily play and the Gauntlet

Every night a community course is automatically picked as the daily challenge. New race each morning, no manual work.

The Gauntlet is one course the whole subreddit builds together. Anyone proposes the next section, everyone votes, and the top pick gets added to the end each night. The course gets longer every day on its own. The leaderboard carries over.

Every course has Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Author medal targets. The Author time is the creator's direct challenge to whoever races it.

## How it's built

The game runner is a Phaser scene. Physics is written by hand: acceleration, friction, terminal velocity, wall mechanics, corner correction. The ghost records position and state every frame and replays it live for whoever races next. Screen shake on wipeout, camera flash on finish, tweened overlays for the countdown. The editor is plain canvas — it doesn't need a game loop and keeping it separate meant changes there never touched the runner.

Courses, leaderboards, ghosts, wipeout markers, the Gauntlet, and daily rotation all live in Redis. Two scheduled jobs run each night — one rotates the daily course, one promotes the top-voted Gauntlet segment. They re-arm on install and upgrade so existing installs don't go stale.
